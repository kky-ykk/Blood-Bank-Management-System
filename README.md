# Blood Bank Management System

## Introduction

The Blood Bank Management System is a web-based application designed to facilitate blood donation and ensure timely availability of blood for those in need. This system allows users to register as blood donors and enables individuals in need of blood to search for potential donors based on blood group and location. If no suitable donors are found, the system provides contact information for major life-saving contacts in various cities.

## Technologies Used
